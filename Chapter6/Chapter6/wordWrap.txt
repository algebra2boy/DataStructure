For example, which language, for how long, and from where you learned. (If you haven’t coded before, that’s okay! We’re looking for a balance of experienced and beginner hackers. Feel free to talk about any past projects you've worked on--this can be a school project, or computer science project!)

I have been learning Java for one and half year, and I learned from my computer class from my teacher, Paul Marques. I had done a few mini projects, like hangman(guessing letter given a blank string); pascal triangle(a triangular array of the binomial coefficients); Magic square(creating a square that the sum of numbers in diagonal/row/column are the same ); Mastermind(multiplayer guessing the correct color to predict the final string); Long distance(calculating the cost of calls, costs from different day and hours vary);Roman numbers(printing Roman numbers in a simplest way); Transporter(character-character interaction game). Now I have been working on one game, Tic Tac Toe.
